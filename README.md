🧠 Vichaar — An AI-Assisted Vision
"Ideas are seeds. Technology is just the soil."

Vichaar is a creative and philosophical social platform, originally envisioned as a space where users can write poetry, express ideas, and engage in thoughtful discussions.
This repo explores how that vision can be brought to life—not just through traditional coding, but through the collaborative power of AI.

🔍 What This Repo Represents
This repository is part of an ongoing experiment:
Can AI help me build my vision faster, better, and more creatively?

Here, I’m:

Using AI to explore UI/UX prototypes, frontend generation, and feature planning.

Testing the limits of current AI tools in executing complex, human-centered ideas.

Learning to balance my own creativity with machine efficiency.

🎯 My Goals
Understand where AI shines and where human input remains essential.

Build a working prototype of Vichaar that feels true to its original spirit.

Share learnings and reflections with the community—especially student devs like myself navigating this new AI-native landscape.
